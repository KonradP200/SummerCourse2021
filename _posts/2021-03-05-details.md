  STEP IN AND SPIN YOUR MIND - INTRODUCTION TO NEW ABSORPTION TECHNOLOGY
  As you probably know, absorption is present in almost every type of industry. Specific requirements of each industrial branch result in vast diversity between different types    and operational modes of absorption processes. In this course, a team of professionals will explain to you the basics of a new, promising technology, which is absorption with the use of rotating packed beds (RPBs). It can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from flue gases, or replace already existing solutions, which may lead to intensification of any gas absorption process. Please note that during the event, a trial version of Ansys might be used. Please make sure that you can run it on your computer. 
In these trying times, when everything seems to be closed or restricted, we will bring novelty back into your lives, regardless of the pandemic situation! After classes, you will have an opportunity to take part in social activities, where you can meet international students and foreign cultures, improve your English skills, and explore the rather unknown, but wonderful city of Lodz. Just apply and spin your mind with us.
