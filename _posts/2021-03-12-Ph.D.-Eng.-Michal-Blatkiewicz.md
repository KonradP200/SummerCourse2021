Graduated with distinction at Cracow University of Technology as master of engineering in the field of chemical and process engineering. Afterwards he did his PhD at Technical University of Lodz, Faculty of Process and Environmental Engineering, where he was also employed as a scientific project contractor. After graduation he worked at Technical University of Hamburg for a year as a post-doc. Currently he is employed as a postdoc at Technical University of Lodz.
During his PhD studies, his work was concerned with continuous processes of biosynthesis, concentration, and purification of fungal laccases, in which he focused mostly on novel downstream processing methods, such as aqueous two-phase extraction and foam fractionation. During his TUHH postdoctoral fellowship he investigated the integration of biocatalysis and distillation in the form of a process called enzymatic reactive distillation. Currently he is a part of a research team concerned mostly with rotating packed bed processes. 
He is an author of 10 scientific papers published in ISI-listed journals, and has presented at 7 international conferences.
