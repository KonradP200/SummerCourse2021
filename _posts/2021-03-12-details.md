  <p>STEP IN AND SPIN YOUR MIND - INTRODUCTION TO NEW ABSORPTION TECHNOLOGY</p>
  <p>
  As you probably know, absorption is present in almost every type of industry. Specific requirements of each industrial branch result in vast diversity between different types    and operational modes of absorption processes. In this course, a team of professionals will explain to you the basics of a new, promising technology, which is absorption with the use of rotating packed beds (RPBs). It can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from flue gases, or replace already existing solutions, which may lead to intensification of any gas absorption process. Please note that during the event, a trial version of Ansys might be used. Please make sure that you can run it on your computer. </p>
