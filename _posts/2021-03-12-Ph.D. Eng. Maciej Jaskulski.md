Maciej Jaskulski, Ph.D., graduated from the Faculty of Process and Environmental Engineering of the Lodz University of Technology. In 2010, he began doctoral studies, during which he completed a two-year research internship at The Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg. His doctoral dissertation entitled "CFD Modelling of Particle Agglomeration in Counter - Current Spray Drying Process" receives the Excellence Award in Drying and Freeze-Drying by the European Federation of Chemical Engineering (EFCE). Currently, Maciej Jaskulski deals with issues related to drying processes in dispersed systems. CFD modelling of mass, heat, and momentum exchange processes during multiphase flows in dispersed systems. Analysis of the influence of process parameters on the quality and morphology of the spray drying product. Additionally, Ph.D. Maciej Jaskulski is the supervisor of a research club, he likes the company of students whom he tries to engage in scientific work on research projects.
