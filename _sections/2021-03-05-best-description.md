BEST - Board of European Students of Technology was founded in 1989 as a non-profit and non-political organisation which constantly provides communication, co-operation and exchange possibilities for students all over Europe. There are 93 Local BEST Groups in 34 countries which are creating a well organised, young and innovative student network.

Locally, BEST Łódź has been constantly working since 1998. The core of our Local BEST Group consist of energetic, enthusiastic and innovative young students. We associate about 50 active members who are hard-working and bring our activities to life. One of our goals is to integrate three environments: students, academic and economic. We are doing so by creating a profile of a modern engineer. 

Our vision is “Empowered diversity” and we provide that with our mission, which is “Developing students”. BEST wants people to understand and respect different cultures and societies, which can help them to work to their full potential and to act responsibly. We are trying to achieve our goals by helping students to broaden their horizons, reach an international mindset and to develop the capacity to work in diverse environments.

Our BESTies are motivated due to our BEST Spirit – the 5 values which help us in achieving all goals we put in front of us.
