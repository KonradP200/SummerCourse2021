Hello lovely Szyszko!
I want to give you some hints :P

How to post on Home:
0. Make sure you are on dev branch!!! By default you are on master.
1. Go to _sections folder
2. Copy content of existing .md file (You can do that by pressing raw -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c) 
3. Create new .md file (Add file -> Create new file)
4. Paste copied content
5. Modify content as needed
	a. title - this field represents the name of your post. It will be visible in menu list.
	b. order - decrement by 1 (as you copied content from most recent post). This field represents the order of posts in home tab.
	c. layout: post - don't change anything or contact with main dev Marcel Bednarczyk
	d. icon - can be changed most popular are: fa-laptop, fa-info, fa-search, fa-homefa, fa-book, fa-check, etc. You can find more of them on https://fontawesome.com/icons website. Keep that in mind that not all of them will work because of regular access.
	e. After 3-dashed block you have content. You can paste there plain text.
