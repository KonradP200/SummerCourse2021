Hello lovely Szyszko!
I want to give you some hints :P

How to post on Home:
1. Go to _sections folder
2. Copy content of existing .md file (You can do that by pressing raw -> ctrl+a -> ctrl+c) 
3. Create new .md file (Add file -> Create new file)
4. Paste copied content
5. Modify content as needed
	a. title - this field represents the name of your post. It will be visible in menu list.
	b. order - decrement by 1 (as you copied content from most recent post). This field represents the order of posts in home tab.
	c. layout - don't change anything or contact with main dev Marcel Bednarczyk
	d. icon - can be changed most popular are: fa-laptop, fa-info, fa-search, fa-homefa, fa-book, fa-check, etc. You can find more of them on https://fontawesome.com/icons website. Keep that in mind that not all of them will work because of regular access.
	e. After 3-dashed block you have content. You can paste there plain text.
6. Add appropriate comment (in english, in present tense eg. "New post about flamingos, please check if flamingo icon works")
